# About Me
## My Interest
My two main interests outside of school are Gunpla and video games. Gunpla are plastic model kits of Gundam mecha which is a large robot. These model kits can range in a variety of sizes and detail.
As far as video games go I enjoy playing MMOs and League of Legends. Currently I mainly play Final Fantasy Online XIV and spend time hanging out with friends doing quests and dungeons.

## Websites I Recommend
	- Try Hack Me (https://tryhackme.com): This website is great for those looking to build a basic understanding of cybersecurity or even simpler things like networking and computer operating systems
	- Youtube (Youtube.com): While this may seem like a joke entry or easy target, I really do recommend Youtube as a website. There are so many resources and videos to be found on the platform in all sorts of professions and categories that it is a great website to use when you need something explained or just an extra view point.
